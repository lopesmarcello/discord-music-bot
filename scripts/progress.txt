## Codebase Patterns
- TypeScript typecheck: `cd dashboard && npm run typecheck` (tsc -b --noEmit)
- Python lint: `ruff check bot/` (not installed in local env; runs in CI only)
- Python tests: `pytest --tb=short` (not installed in local env; runs in CI only)
- PRD is a markdown file at `tasks/prd-dashboard-skip-and-guild-fixes.md` (not prd.json)
- Mark story done by checking `[ ]` → `[x]` in the markdown PRD
- JWT middleware (`make_jwt_middleware` in `bot/api/auth.py`) decodes the token but does NOT store it on `request` — handlers must decode it themselves if they need payload
- `skipTrack()` in `api.ts` already returns `QueueData` (`{current, tracks}`) — backend change not needed for US-002

## 2026-03-01 - US-003
- Verified QueueView skip behaviour — no code changes needed
- `onQueueChanged` → increments `queueRefreshKey` → triggers `loadQueue()` (GET only) in QueueView; no double POST
- By the time `onQueueChanged` fires, `await skipTrack()` has resolved so backend is stable
- Files changed: `tasks/prd-dashboard-skip-and-guild-fixes.md` (checked off criteria)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `DashboardPage` wires PlayerBar.onQueueChanged to `setQueueRefreshKey((k) => k + 1)`, which QueueView uses as `refreshTrigger`
  - `refreshTrigger` in QueueView only calls `loadQueue()` (GET `/api/queue`), never a POST
---

## 2026-03-01 - US-002
- Fixed `PlayerBar.handleSkip` to use skip response data, removed `fetchData()` call
- Files changed: `dashboard/src/components/PlayerBar.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: `const updated = await skipTrack(guildId); setCurrentTrack(updated.current);`
  - Do NOT call `fetchData()` right after skip — let 5s poll correct drift
  - `onQueueChanged?.()` still called to refresh QueueView via `refreshTrigger`
---

## 2026-03-01 - US-001
- Investigated and documented the skip-clearing race condition
- Files changed: `dashboard/src/components/PlayerBar.tsx` (added race condition comment), `tasks/prd-dashboard-skip-and-guild-fixes.md` (checked off acceptance criteria)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `PlayerBar.handleSkip` discards `skipTrack()` return value and immediately calls `fetchData()` — this is the bug
  - `bot/api/player.py:handle_queue_skip` awaits `_play_next` before responding, but the Discord VC may still report `is_playing()=False` briefly after `_play_next` returns (async audio setup race)
  - `QueueView.handleSkip` already does the correct thing: uses skip response directly, no re-fetch
  - `skipTrack()` in `api.ts` already returns `{current, tracks}` — no backend changes needed for US-002
