## Codebase Patterns
- pytest must be run with `PYTHONPATH=/tmp/pypackages` since packages cannot be installed system-wide (no pip, no PyPI access in this environment)
- Packages were bootstrapped from GitHub: pytest wheel from GitHub releases, pluggy/packaging/pygments cloned from GitHub and extracted to /tmp/pypackages
- pluggy requires a dist-info directory to report its version; created manually at /tmp/pypackages/pluggy-1.6.0.dist-info/
- The environment uses Python 3.11.2 on Debian with EXTERNALLY-MANAGED flag; use --target or custom PYTHONPATH for package management
- GitHub is accessible (allowed by firewall); PyPI is NOT accessible
- All bot modules are in bot/ with stubs raising NotImplementedError until their story is implemented
- Tests are in tests/unit/ (pure unit tests) and tests/integration/ (mocked Discord tests)
- AudioResolver uses dependency injection: `AudioResolver(ytdl_class=..., spotipy_client=...)` for testability; production deps lazy-imported with `# pragma: no cover`
- yt_dlp / spotipy are not installed; mock them via `unittest.mock.patch.dict("sys.modules", {...})` or inject mocks at constructor time
- yt_dlp search queries wrap results in `{"entries": [...]}` – resolver unwraps `entries[0]` automatically
- `MagicMock` supports context manager protocol natively; access the `with` block value via `mock_class.return_value.__enter__.return_value`
- GuildQueueRegistry (in bot/audio/queue.py) manages per-guild Queue instances; use `registry.get_queue(guild_id)` in command handlers

## 2026-02-27 - US-001
- Created full project scaffold: pyproject.toml, .env.example, .gitignore, README.md
- Created directory structure: bot/, bot/cogs/, bot/audio/, tests/unit/, tests/integration/
- Created stub modules: bot/audio/resolver.py (AudioResolver, AudioTrack, UnsupportedSourceError), bot/audio/queue.py (Queue), bot/audio/voice.py (VoiceManager), bot/cogs/music.py (Music cog with all commands as stubs), bot/bot.py, bot/__main__.py
- Created placeholder test files for all future stories
- Created tests/test_scaffold.py with 5 passing smoke tests
- Created scripts/prd.json with all 10 user stories (US-001 marked passes: true)
- Files changed: pyproject.toml, .env.example, .gitignore, README.md, bot/*, tests/*
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - No pip available system-wide; packages must be bootstrapped from GitHub and put in /tmp/pypackages
  - Run pytest as: `PYTHONPATH=/tmp/pypackages python3 -m pytest`
  - asyncio_mode config option requires pytest-asyncio installed; removed from pyproject.toml until US-004/005
  - The `pyproject.toml` has `asyncio_mode` removed for now - add it back in US-004 when pytest-asyncio is bootstrapped

## 2026-02-27 - US-003
- Wrote 25 unit tests for Queue and GuildQueueRegistry (RED phase: failed at import; GREEN phase: all pass)
- Implemented Queue with add/next/peek/clear/list; all empty-queue edge cases handled
- Implemented GuildQueueRegistry with get_queue(guild_id) and delete_queue(guild_id)
- Files changed: bot/audio/queue.py, tests/unit/test_queue.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Queue.list() returns a copy (`list(self._tracks)`) so callers can't mutate internal state
  - GuildQueueRegistry is the idiomatic way to obtain per-guild queues; instantiate once in the Music cog or bot
  - No external dependencies needed for Queue – pure Python, no mocking required in tests

## 2026-02-27 - US-002
- Wrote 20 unit tests for AudioResolver (RED phase: all failed; GREEN phase: all pass)
- Implemented AudioResolver with dependency injection (`ytdl_class`, `spotipy_client` constructor params)
- Files changed: bot/audio/resolver.py, tests/unit/test_resolver.py
- Patterns covered: YouTube URL, Spotify URL (Spotipy metadata + YouTube fallback), SoundCloud URL, plain search, unsupported URL
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `AudioResolver(ytdl_class=mock, spotipy_client=mock)` in all resolver tests – no sys.modules hacking needed for functional tests
  - Test lazy-import paths by pre-populating `sys.modules` with mocks and calling `_get_ytdl_class()` / `_get_spotipy_client()` directly
  - yt_dlp wraps search results: info dict has `"entries"` key; resolver handles this in `_extract_info()`
  - MagicMock context manager: ydl instance accessible via `mock_class.return_value.__enter__.return_value`
