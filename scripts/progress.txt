## Codebase Patterns
- Python tests use stubs in tests/conftest.py (aiohttp.web, jwt) — never need real aiohttp/PyJWT in tests
- pytest is not installed; use: PYTHONPATH=/tmp/pypackages:/workspace python3.11 -m pytest tests/ -v
  (first download pip: curl -sL https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/pip.pyz -o /tmp/pip.pyz && python3.11 /tmp/pip.pyz install pytest --target /tmp/pypackages)
- Bot guilds accessed via request.app["bot"].guilds; each guild has .id (int), .name (str), .icon (str|None)
- Guild IDs are integers on Discord objects but must be serialised as strings in JSON
- JWT middleware auto-protects all routes not starting with /auth/; new API routes are auto-protected
- TypeScript typecheck: cd /workspace/dashboard && npm run typecheck
- New API modules follow pattern: handle_X_get() function + setup_X_routes(app) function

## 2026-02-28 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added GET /api/guilds endpoint that returns guilds the bot is in
- Files changed:
  - bot/api/guilds.py (new): handle_guilds_get() and setup_guilds_routes()
  - bot/api/server.py: registered guilds routes via setup_guilds_routes()
  - dashboard/src/api.ts: added Guild interface and fetchGuilds() function
  - tests/test_guilds_api.py (new): 7 tests covering happy path, empty states, icon=None, string IDs
  - scripts/prd.json (new): created prd.json for new PRD
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - pytest is not installed; install to /tmp/pypackages and set PYTHONPATH (see Codebase Patterns above)
  - The mock_web.Response fake in conftest.py stores text as a string attribute; json.loads(resp.text) is the way to inspect responses
  - bot.guilds list has guild objects with .id (int), .name, .icon attributes; id must be str() in JSON
